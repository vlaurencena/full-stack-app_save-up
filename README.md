Hi! 

This is Save Up, a full-stack app built with React (frontend) and Strapi (backend). 

Notice that it is still not possible to create a new user, so feel free to log in with (and play around) the testing users' credentials provided on the Login page.

## Description

This is an app that helps you keep track of your expenses, and savings. You can also access resources to learn how to save money, which are exclusive to Save Up users.

It still has a basic functionality. In the future, it should also have:
* Possibility to edit/delete entries.
* Register new user form.
* Rensponsive design.
* Set and track saving related objectives.
* A page showcasing offers relevant to user's location.
* A feed similar to Twitter, where a users can follow each other, and share content.
* New user's roles (resources creators, and businesses for the offer's section).
