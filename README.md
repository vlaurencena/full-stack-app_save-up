Hi! 

This is Save Up, a full-stack app built with React (frontend) and Strapi (backend).

## Getting started

To run this project on your machine, please follow these steps.

### 1)
First, `cd` to the route where you want to install this app.

### 2)
Then, `git clone` this repisotory.

Now, you'll have downloaded this app that has two main folders:
* frontend
* backend

### 3)
`cd` to the backend folder, and run the commands `npm install` and `npm run develop`.

The server should be running on port http://localhost:1337/. 

You can visit that URL to check.
### 4)
Finally, `cd` to the front end folder, and run the commands `npm install` and `npm start`.

The React app should be running on port http://localhost:3000/.

Head to that URL to use Save Up.
